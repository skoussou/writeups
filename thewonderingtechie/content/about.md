Stelios Kousouris is an Applications Consulting Architect and aspired technology speaker at Red Hat EMEA. His main interests are in application development, application security, business applications analysis, application verification and delivery automation, cloud technologies, application modernization for cloud environments and building efficient teams (forming to performing).

With over 20 years of working experience in the field, he has experienced multiple IT roles, technologies, and languages. Stelios has worked with over 100 customers from diverse business domains including small to medium organizations as well as multi-national/multi-border listed organizations based in Europe, Middle-East and Africa. These experiences have allowed him to be able to capture and maintain multiple points of view of technical and business interest when considering various technologies allowing him to make appropriate propositions supported with a clear plan for adoption and delivery by the relevant customer groups.

He is also very keen on forming and guiding teams to achieve greater performing efficiency, teams that take pride in the outcome of their work and joy in the process in doing so. In this pursuit, he promotes openness and transparency in his interactions, introducting techniques which remove barriers, enhance clarity and award recognition where it is due.

Stelios has always been a curious mind and he has found an application to this ability in the experimentation and application with technologies. An avid learner of almost anything he joins the early adopters in the "Technology adoption life cycle" with his moto around this experience being "learn early, fall, get up and fall again, teach others how not to"!
